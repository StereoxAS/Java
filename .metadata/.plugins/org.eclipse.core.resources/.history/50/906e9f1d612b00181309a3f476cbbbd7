				+ "It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; "
				+ "perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. "
				+ "Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. "
				+ "They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and "
				+ "have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. "
				+ "Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. "
				+ "Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.\n"
				+ "Sorcerers have +4 bonus to Charisma.";
